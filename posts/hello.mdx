There is a code snippet below:
```
export function myComponent(){
    return (
        <p>test</p>
    )
}
```

$$ x^2+2x+1 $$

And here is a table:

| Col 1 | Col 2 |

| val 1 | val 2 |
| val 3 | val 4 |


Solving for $$x$$ in the equation $$3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0$$:




First, we can check if the equation can be factored. Unfortunately, the quadratic does not factor nicely, so we'll use the quadratic formula.

The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$, the solutions for $$x$$ are given by:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

In our equation, we have $$a = 3$$, $$b = 5$$, and $$c = -2$$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

$$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(3)(-2)}}{2(3)}$$

Simplifying further:

$$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 24}}{6}$$

$$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{49}}{6}$$

$$x = \frac{-5 \pm 7}{6}$$

Therefore, the solutions to the equation $$3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0$$ are:

$$x_1 = \frac{-5 + 7}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$$

$$x_2 = \frac{-5 - 7}{6} = -2$$

Hence, the solutions for $$x$$ are $$x = \frac{1}{3}$$ and $$x = -2$$.
