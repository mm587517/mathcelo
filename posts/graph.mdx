The graph of the function $$ f(x) = x^2 $$ is a parabola. It is a U-shaped curve that opens upwards if the coefficient of $$x^2$$ is positive (in this case, the coefficient is 1) and opens downwards if the coefficient is negative.

As $$x$$ increases, the value of $$x^2$$ increases rapidly. Similarly, as x decreases, the value of $$x^2$$ increases rapidly but in the positive direction (i.e., becomes more positive). When $$x$$ is equal to $$0$$, the value of$$x^2$$ is also $$0$$.

The symmetry of the parabola can be observed as the graph is symmetrical with respect to the vertical line passing through the vertex. The vertex of the parabola is the point where the graph reaches its minimum (if it opens upwards) or maximum (if it opens downwards). In this case, since the coefficient of $$x^2$$ is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex is the lowest point on the graph.

As the absolute value of $$x$$ gets larger and larger, the values of $$x^2$$ also increase without bound. This results in the graph extending infinitely upwards and downwards along the y-axis.

Overall, the graph of $$x^2$$ is a smooth and continuous curve that exhibits the characteristics of a parabola, and it is one of the fundamental functions in mathematics and plays a crucial role in various applications and mathematical principles.
